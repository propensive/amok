# Amok

__A comprehensive API documentation system__

Amok is a comprehensive tool for authoring, maintaining and sharing software documentation, in various forms.

Providing documentation for software is a human communication challenge, with the primary goal to give users the
most correct, precise and up-to-date information that's available, and a secondary goal of facilitating the
development and continuance of that information in pristine condition.

## Features

TBC


## Availability

Amok has not yet been published as a binary.

## Getting Started

TBC


## Status

Amok is classified as __embryotic__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Amok is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 615 lines of code.

## Building

Amok can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Amok are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/amok/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Amok easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Author

Amok was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and training is available from
[Propensive O&Uuml;](https://propensive.com/).



## Name

TBC

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
